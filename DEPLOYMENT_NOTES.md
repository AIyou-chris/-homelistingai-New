# Deployment Notes

## Latest Deployment - July 28, 2025 (PERSISTENT LISTINGS FIX)

### âœ… Deployment Status: SUCCESS
- **Production URL:** https://homelistingai.com
- **Deploy URL:** https://6886d1d624631c0bbef755f7--homelistinai.netlify.app
- **Files Uploaded:** 239 files
- **Build Method:** `npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=dist --no-build`

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PERSISTENCE FIX:
**Fixed listings not being saved to persistent store** - Now they actually persist!

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **Persistent Mock Store** - Changed from `const listings` to `let mockListings` for persistence
2. **CreateListing Persistence** - Now adds created listings to persistent mock store
3. **GetAgentListings Integration** - Now returns listings from persistent store + new ones
4. **Console Logging** - Added debugging to track listings being added and retrieved

#### **Root Cause:**
- `createListing` was creating mock listings but not saving them anywhere
- `getAgentListings` was returning different static mock data
- No persistence between function calls meant created listings disappeared
- Fixed by creating persistent in-memory store that survives between calls

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL LISTINGS DISPLAY FIX:
**Fixed listings not showing in dashboard after building** - The core workflow issue!

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **DashboardPage Using Wrong User ID** - Changed from hardcoded `'dev-user-id'` to actual `user.id`
2. **Wrong Navigation Target** - Changed "Edit in Your Dashboard" from `/dashboard` to `/dashboard/listings`
3. **User Dependency** - Added `user` dependency to `useEffect` to reload when user changes
4. **Console Logging** - Added debugging to track user ID and listings loading

#### **Root Cause:**
- DashboardPage was loading listings for `'dev-user-id'` instead of the real user
- "Edit in Your Dashboard" button was going to wrong page (`/dashboard` vs `/dashboard/listings`)
- Built listings were being saved correctly but dashboard wasn't loading the right user's data

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ASSET LOADING FIX:
**Fixed 404 errors for JavaScript assets** - `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **Conflicting Redirects** - Removed `public/_redirects` file that conflicted with `netlify.toml`
2. **Asset Routing** - Added proper `/assets/*` redirect in `netlify.toml`
3. **BuildAIListingPage** - Fixed 404 errors for `BuildAIListingPage-BCUFWHs5.js`
4. **All JavaScript Assets** - Fixed 404 errors for all `.js` files

#### **Root Cause:**
- `_redirects` file was overriding `netlify.toml` redirects
- Assets weren't being served correctly due to conflicting routing rules
- Build page couldn't load because JavaScript modules failed to fetch

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
**Fixed 22 Console Errors** - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '0')`

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **ListingCard.tsx Line 40** - Added null check for `listing.image_urls?.[0]`
2. **Title/Address** - Added fallbacks for `listing.title || 'Untitled Listing'`
3. **Price/Properties** - Added fallbacks for `listing.price || 0`, `listing.bedrooms || 0`
4. **Description** - Added fallback for `listing.description || 'No description available'`

#### **Root Cause:**
- Listing data was null/undefined but components tried to access properties
- Missing null checks caused 22 console errors
- Dashboard was crashing when trying to display listings

### ðŸ”§ Changes Deployed:
1. **Fixed Dashboard Routing** - Updated App.tsx to use simplified DashboardPage
2. **Simplified Dashboard** - Removed complex components causing errors
3. **Real Listing Loading** - Dashboard now loads listings from service
4. **Build Flow Fixes** - Fixed routing and navigation issues

### ðŸ§ª Testing Ready:
- **Dashboard:** https://homelistingai.com/dashboard
- **Build Flow:** https://homelistingai.com/build-ai-listing
- **Sales Page:** https://homelistingai.com/sales

### ðŸ“‹ Test Plan:
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click "Add New Listing"
3. Build 4-5 listings using test URLs
4. Verify listings appear in dashboard

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results:
- Dashboard loads without JavaScript errors
- Build process completes successfully
- Each listing appears in dashboard
- Count increases with each build
