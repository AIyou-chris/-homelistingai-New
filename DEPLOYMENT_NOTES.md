### âœ… Deployment Status: SUCCESS
- **Production URL:** https://homelistingai.com
- **Deploy URL:** https://6886cbab777471fce9c0ffee--homelistinai.netlify.app
- **Files Uploaded:** 0 files (cached)
- **Build Method:** `npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=dist --no-build`

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ASSET LOADING FIX:
**Fixed 404 errors for JavaScript assets** - `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **Conflicting Redirects** - Removed `public/_redirects` file that conflicted with `netlify.toml`
2. **Asset Routing** - Added proper `/assets/*` redirect in `netlify.toml`
3. **BuildAIListingPage** - Fixed 404 errors for `BuildAIListingPage-BCUFWHs5.js`
4. **All JavaScript Assets** - Fixed 404 errors for all `.js` files

#### **Root Cause:**
- `_redirects` file was overriding `netlify.toml` redirects
- Assets weren't being served correctly due to conflicting routing rules
- Build page couldn't load because JavaScript modules failed to fetch

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
**Fixed 22 Console Errors** - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '0')`

#### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **ListingCard.tsx Line 40** - Added null check for `listing.image_urls?.[0]`
2. **Title/Address** - Added fallbacks for `listing.title || 'Untitled Listing'`
3. **Price/Properties** - Added fallbacks for `listing.price || 0`, `listing.bedrooms || 0`
4. **Description** - Added fallback for `listing.description || 'No description available'`

#### **Root Cause:**
- Listing data was null/undefined but components tried to access properties
- Missing null checks caused 22 console errors
- Dashboard was crashing when trying to display listings

### ðŸ”§ Changes Deployed:
1. **Fixed Dashboard Routing** - Updated App.tsx to use simplified DashboardPage
2. **Simplified Dashboard** - Removed complex components causing errors
3. **Real Listing Loading** - Dashboard now loads listings from service
